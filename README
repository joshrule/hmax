HMAX: Hierarchical Model And X
==============================

HMAX is a hierarchical, shape-based, computational model of visual object recognition in cortex. It summarizes the basic facts of the ventral visual stream, thought to mediate object recognition in cortex.

- AUTHORS: a list of the project's authors and maintainers

- LICENSE: the project's license

- README: this document

- C1.m: Given an image, this function returns S1 & C1 unit responses

- C2.m: Given an image, this function returns S1, C1, S2, & C2 unit responses.

- c1rFromCells.m: Extract all C1 layer responses for a set of images.

- example.m: Given the path to an image, this function returns unit responses for that image, the patches and filters used, and total run time

- extractC2FromCell.m: Extract all C2 layer responses for a set of images.

- initGabor.m: Given orientations and receptive field sizes, this function returns a set of Gabor filters

- maxFilter.m: Given an image and pooling range, this function returns a matrix of the image's maximum values in each neighborhood defined by the pooling range

- padImage.m: Given an image, padding amount, and padding method, this function returns a padded image. Think of it as padarray operating on only the first 2 dimensions of a 3 dimensional array.

- sumFilter.m: Given an image and pooling range, this function returns an image where each "pixel" represents the sums of the pixel values within the pooling range of the original pixel.

- unpadImage.m: undoes padimage - given an image and padding amount, this function strips padding off an image

- windowedPatchDistance.m: given an image and patch, this function computes the euclidean distance between the patch and all crops of the image of similar size.
