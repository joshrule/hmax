% given an image extracts layers s1 c1 s2 and finally c2
% for inputs stim, filters, fSiz, c1SpaceSS,c1ScaleeSS, and c1OL
% see the documentation for C1 (C1.m)
%
% briefly, 
% stim is the input image. 
% filters fSiz, c1SpaceSS, c1ScaleSS, c1OL are the parameters of
% the c1 process
%
% s2Target are the prototype (patches) to be used in the extraction
% of s2.  Each patch of size [n,n,d] is stored as a column in s2Target,
% which has itself a size of [n*n*d, n_patches];
%
% if available, a precomputed c1 layer can be used to save computation
% time.  The proper format is the output of C1.m
